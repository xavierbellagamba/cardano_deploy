# Cardano Deploy
Hi! In this repo, we propose a semi-automated approach that facilitates the deployment of Cardano node on Linux machines. We believe node operations should be made more broadly available. This aims at democratizing pool operations and should have the following positive side effects:
- Improve the network security (the more nodes, the more resistant to sybil attacks)
- Increase network decentralization (which is the final aim of public blockchain)
- XX

## How to use
The successful deployment of a Cardano stake pool using this approach can be decomposed into XXX steps:
1. xx
2. xx

## Minimum configuration
Two to three machines are necessary to operate a staking pool. 
The proposed automated deployment approach requires these machines to have the following requirements:

OS: Ubuntu 20+
CPU: 2 cores @ 1.8GHz (x86_64 arch)
RAM: 16GB
Storage: 30GB (preferably SSD)
High-speed and stable internet connection

## Disclaimer
- Security aspects are not covered. Aspiring pool operators should do their own research on the matter and apply state-of-the-art security.
- The authors do not guarantee the success of the deployment
- The authors are not responsible for any loss of tokens or cash caused by the deployment and operation of the stake pool
- This approach only aims at facilitating the deployment of Cardano node, making it more accessible for non-expert users
